So wheres da fix then huh?! Suggestions range from strict rent control measures tightens grip o' landlords somewhat restrictive yet could stifle growth itself another idea floats - incentivize affordable housing projects near downtown areas might attract mixed income groups help blend things back together kinda tricky though unintended consequences creep inn like potentially disrupt local markets again or change character entirely making place less authentic its own uniqueness eroded bit by bitter bite over time sadly trade offs always loom large here between progress & preserving past charm deeply complex puzzle indeed...... 😔😢🏙️‍♂️"
